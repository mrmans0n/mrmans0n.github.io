Worst job offer ever.

![](http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/21/cto_intern.png)

A 
CTO offer, with that many technologies required (they ask for high skill in them)… 40h per week (8 hours/day) with a contract of 4 months being an intern. Yes, a 
CTO intern. And for 600€ ($775). Unbelievable. I don’t know if cry or kill myself.

The worst part of it… 16 applicants.
