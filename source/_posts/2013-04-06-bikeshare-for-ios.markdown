The wait seemed so long… 6 and a half days later, 
**BikeShare! is on the App Store**
. As 
[I said it would](/shipping-as-fast-as-possible) before.

In fact, the wait time made me improve a lot the app I sent, so once it was released I uploaded a new version and started the cycle again… and “Waiting for Review”.

Anyway, if you like riding a bike and your city has a public bike services, and you happen to have an iPhone, maybe this app will help you.
