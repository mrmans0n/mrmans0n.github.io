I’ve been working in a 
**clustering code ready for Maps v2**
, as I didn’t found any full example I could use in some of my apps.

So here you have it: a working example of 
[Clustering in Maps v2 for Android](https://github.com/mrmans0n/android-maps-v2-clustering) for use in your projects.

All the 
**setup instructions are in GitHub**
.

You are more than welcome to change things, report issues and make pull requests!
