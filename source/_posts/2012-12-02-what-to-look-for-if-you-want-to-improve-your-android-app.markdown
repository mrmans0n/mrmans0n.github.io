I’ve been witness to some technical Android UI performance discussion between 
[Joaquim Vergès](http://twitter.com/joenrv) (developer of the recently released and awesome Falcon Pro twitter client) and 
[Romain Guy](http://twitter.com/romainguy) (Google Android engineer), and by reading them I realized 
**how often we ignore some very clear guidelines that even lint tells us**
 (such as overdrawing issues), that impact in the framerate of our scrolling in Android apps.

After all the discussion, Romain Guy synthesized his analysis 
[in a post in his web](http://www.curious-creature.org/docs/android-performance-case-study-1.html). 
**Very recommended reading**
 for a Sunday morning 
IMHO.
