Some time ago this article spread like wildfire, stating the scientific facts we all coders know but are too lazy to look for.

What was my resolution then?

I bought them.

I always try to get into the zone with good headphones and music (ahem, Spotify premium). That, and a little 
respect of the people around me do the magic. Also, closing Mail and Messages help a little. And caffeine. Arenâ€™t we coders picky?

An interrupted programmer is a buggy and angry one, and very prone to produce horrendous 
code smells our future selves would be suicidal with. 
**Let us work, dammit!**
