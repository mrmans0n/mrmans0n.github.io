I will be able to test my stuff in a new Android guinea pig, and boy… what a beautiful guinea pig the 
**HTC One**
 is.

And, for the first time ever, Sense is not a bother. It’s just beautiful.

But nevertheless I’m excited about the Google Edition when it comes at the end of this month.

Also I’ve stumbled upon a brand new 
**iPhone 4S**
, courtesy of 
[Mobivery](http://www.mobivery.com), for testing purposes.

The dual core in iOS is a must since iOS 6, my old iPhone 4 couldn’t keep up at all (and when I tried iOS 7 beta 1 there, I swear I saw the iPhone phisically sweat). So pretty excited to try my stuff in there too, and see it runs smoothly.

Instrumentation tests, there I go!
