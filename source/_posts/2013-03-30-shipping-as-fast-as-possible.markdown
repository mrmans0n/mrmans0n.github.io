I’m taking 
**a different approach**
 with my newest app, 
**BikeShare! for iOS**
.

I always wanted to have a lot of functionality done before I could even think about shipping, but it seems a really bad idea now. Sure, the app would be awesome when done… but 
**when would that be**
? I have very little free time and a lot of projects going on, shifting my focus from time to time due priority changes or even boredom whims, so it’s hard to know about times.

So I changed my mind. I decided on a basic core functionality and went with it. The 1.0 version will have that and nothing more.

Then I will have some valuable info I might need to know before adding more functionality. With the core done and some stats mining frameworks set up, like 
[**Malcom**](http://www.mymalcom.com), I can know for sure what my users might want to have in the next iterations.

All the extra functionality, even the stuff to make the app different from others, 
**will have to wait**
. And hopefully I’ll get some feedback from the users.

And now, a teaser for you all.

The app is In Review, hopefully in one week or two will be rockin’ on the App Store.
