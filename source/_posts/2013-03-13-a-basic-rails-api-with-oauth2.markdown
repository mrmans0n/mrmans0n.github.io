Iâ€™ve prepared (mostly for myself) 
[a GitHub repo with a pretty basic Rails project featuring Bootstrap and Devise authentication](https://github.com/mrmans0n/oauth2-doorkeeper-for-api) for the backend, and OAuth2 with Doorkeeper for the 
API. The 
API is prepared for versioning and has a pretty basic example for its use.

Hopefully somebody other than me will find some use to it.
