Today the iPad mini was announced, as was announced by the media some months ago. But also a 
**4th gen. iPad**
 was announced.

The 3rd gen. iPad was released 
**7 months ago**
, and now it’s 
**outdated**
 – a 600€ piece of crap. I wonder how the customers feel now.

But if you add to that mixture that 
**iOS 6 deprecated the 1st iPad**
, with only a 
**year and a few months**
 of life…

I’m a happy owner of an iPad 2 but I’m starting to feel a little bit worried of how Apple treats us customers with this crazy deprecating policy.
