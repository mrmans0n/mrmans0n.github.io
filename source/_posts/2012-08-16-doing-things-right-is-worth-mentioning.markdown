I’m always being told that 
**it’s too difficult and even impossible make good interfaces and beautiful apps in Android**
. And I always say the same: given the time and the thought needed, it is more than possible.

Lately more and more 
multi-platform apps are embracing 
**Holo**
, and they are doing it right. For example, the last iteration of 
[foursquare](https://foursquare.com) it’s a good example of a famous app doing things better.

The most recent app, and the reason I’m writing this is 
**Pinterest**
.

They released their iOS app long time ago and Android was left behind, but I think it was worth, because 
[they just released their Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinterest) and it’s 
gorgeous. Custom smooth animations, clever use of the Action Bar, slick design… It’s really a delight. It’s an example to follow, really, even with its rough edges (due to novelty).

Too bad I don’t care about the social network itself.
