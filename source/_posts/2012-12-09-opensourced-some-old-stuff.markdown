I’ve just found and posted in GitHub a pair of 
**old and forgotten projects**
 I had around my HD: 
[ThumbCreator](https://github.com/mrmans0n/ThumbCreator) and 
[Patchwerk](https://github.com/mrmans0n/Patchwerk).

Both were developed with Visual Studio (C#). You wouldn’t believe how much I miss that 
IDE now that I’m stuck with Eclipse and Xcode.

**They never were Opensource to begin with**
, but what the heck, they are simple and maybe someone will send some pull requests with improvements or fixes – In fact, you are encouraged to do so.
