Well, as I did in the past with the [Xcode snippets](http://nlopez.io/blog/2012/05/07/using-dropbox-to-synchronize-xcode-4-snippets/) I'm going to share with everyone my [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) [configuration files in GitHub](https://github.com/mrmans0n/sublime-text-3-config). 

It's pretty simple, it has a pretty common dark theme (RailsCasts style) and some key maps I use all the time. Nothing worth going crazy or whatever.

Anyway, for the curious people, I have it available in [a public GitHub repository](https://github.com/mrmans0n/sublime-text-3-config).
