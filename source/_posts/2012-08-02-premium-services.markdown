I’m subscribed to some 
**premium services**
, and there are two that are 
literally essential to me as a developer. I’m talking about 
[Spotify](http://www.spotify.con) and 
[GitHub](http://github.com).

I’ve been an 
**Spotify**
 subscriber for more than two years. I always code with music, call it white noise, call it whatever you want, I just need something on the background to let me focus and reach 
the zone.

My music varies, it depends on the day and my mood. For analysis and more-thinking-than-coding moments, I usually end up listening to some OSTs like Mass Effect (
[1](http://open.spotify.com/album/3f4qclJfQLXc1xapUxUEJq), 2 and 
[3](http://open.spotify.com/album/4AqNrJQ3uSoonTUgvBQHMX)), Gothic 3, 
[Trent Reznor + Atticus Ross](http://open.spotify.com/artist/6cadOIa5DTh6a5mGo5r4bh) soundtracks (
[TGWTDT](http://open.spotify.com/album/0mAK8JyX2On5kLC3VMMgm7) / 
[The Social Network](http://open.spotify.com/album/1ijkFiMeHopKkHyvQCWxUa)), 
[Hans Zimmer OSTs](http://open.spotify.com/artist/0YC192cP3KPCRWx8zr8MfZ) or some medleys like 
[Video Games Live](http://open.spotify.com/album/6mpHl6so8tgC8TLGXb8e2O) and 
[The Greatest Video Game Music](http://open.spotify.com/album/3bBCofH4VxHokZ6fRCgbGx). For the moments of 
really awesome and destroyer coding I prefer something a little bit electronic like 
[Prodigy](http://open.spotify.com/artist/1GwxXgEc6oxCKQ5wykWXFs), 
[Pendulum](http://open.spotify.com/artist/7MqnCTCAX6SsIYYdJCQj9B) or even more dark stuff like 
[KMFDM](http://open.spotify.com/artist/3V4IvzRQYP5mzuVtkcHgVa), 
[Amaranthe](http://open.spotify.com/artist/2KaW48xlLnXC2v8tvyhWsa) or 
[Zeromancer](http://open.spotify.com/artist/0tQn2q1TIEenLgodtb8Nhx). But most of the time I listen to metal bands and even punk/punk rock, depends on the mood. Of course, I’m talking about coding hours. I also use it in my free time, ain’t it awesome?

Also, I’ve been a 
**GitHub**
 subscriber for some months now. I needed some private repos and it gave me the push I needed to throw my money to the screen. I like the idea and philosophy a lot. It’s our very own (developer’s) social network, and for some time it’s been my second code-related site in number of visits. Of course, the first is 
[StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com).

And 
[Octocat](http://octodex.github.com/) is fucking awesome.

I also use a lot 
**Evernote**
, but still not at the level needed to pay for it. But give me time…
