Windows 8 is better with touch controls, or so they say… and now I’m able to try it.

[Magic Trackpad Control Panel for Windows](http://www.trackpadmagic.com/magic-trackpad/download) allowed me to configure my Magic Trackpad to work with the brand new Windows 8, and worked perfectly. I have my two finger scroll now. Yeah.

Now I’ll have to wait until I can configure 3/4 finger gestures, assign one of them to show the new Metro style part, and everything will be perfect.
