Yeah. Like installing an OS is like achieving something. Didn’t feel this sense of accomplishment since I installed my first Slackware back in… 1999 or something.

Turns out what Windows 8 didn’t liked was other HDs plugged in. And also didn’t liked my pendrive with an microSD card on it. And S.M.A.R.T. enabled in the 
BIOS.

So I unplugged all the HDs and everything else, and it installed in a jiff.

In the end, I wasted a complete weekend. But what the hell, I’m gonna enjoy Visual Studio 2012, that’s for sure.
