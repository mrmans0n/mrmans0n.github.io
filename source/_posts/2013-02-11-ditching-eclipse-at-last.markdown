I’m kind of 
**fed up with Eclipse**
. I acknowledge it’s a good 
IDE, but too broad and too cluttered for me.

So after I returned to work after my forced leave, I finally got to put in practice one of my new year resolutions: switch to 
[IntelliJ 
IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). And when I finally got it to work with my maven setup it was all joy and happiness tears.

And also switched my Ruby / Rails 
IDE to 
[RubyMine 5](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/), though I haven’t bought it yet (still on trial though).

But AppCode still doesn’t do it for me.
