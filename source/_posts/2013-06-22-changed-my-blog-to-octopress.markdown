Well, I'm kind of bored with the design stuff on my blog, so I just wanted to spice up things a little. Also, I've wanted to try *Octopress* for a while... So what the heck, I wrote some export functions to my old blog, and programmed a little import script that converted all that info into Octopress compliant posts. So here it is.

Now I'll have to *find a new design* that makes me feel at home, and everything will be ready.
