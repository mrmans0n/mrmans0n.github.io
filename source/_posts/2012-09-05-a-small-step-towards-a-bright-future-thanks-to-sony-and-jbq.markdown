Tuesday 
[Sony released the binaries](http://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/09/03/sony-release-binaries-to-support-jbqs-vanilla-android-xperia-s-project-download/) needed by a project started by no less than 
**Jean-Baptiste Queru**
, Technical Lead of 
AOSP. 
[The project](https://android.googlesource.com/device/sony/lt26/+/master) is creating a stock Android rom for the Xperia S smartphone.

This means 
**Google itself will be creating a stock rom for a non-nexus device**
 with all the benefits that has (like 
OTA updates).

This rocks for two different reasons.

First of all, Google is taking upon themselves the titanic task of mantaining more devices, even if they are not 
theirs, not a Nexus.

Also, removing the custom launchers and personalization layers the manufacturers blend with their phones is 
**always**
 good. Less load, less excuses and more pure Android flavor. After Ice Cream Sandwich UI revamp the custom layers are definitely not needed.

If this applies to more devices in the future we might be seeing a way out in the impossible task of fighting the fragmentation. And this is awesome.
