I’m always forgetting to install Xcode’s 
**Command Line Tools**
 after every Xcode update.

I mean, if I install it once, why shouldn’t it be installed automatically after each update? Is it really that difficult?

I remember with love and fluffy feelings how my life was before all this. The command line tools were always there, you never had to do anything special… Ah, better times.
