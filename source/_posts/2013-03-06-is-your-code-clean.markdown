I’ve been reading some technical stuff lately. My latest prey has been 
[Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), by “Uncle Bob” Robert C. Martin.

It has been very revealing about a ton of stuff and made me think a lot about what I could improve, although I don’t 100% agree with everything Bob says. I’ve also applied some of the key points to the Android coding style I recently wrote for 
[Mobivery](http://www.mobivery.com), in the naming conventions for example.

Well… It’s very recommended for everyone! I wish I read it in college.
