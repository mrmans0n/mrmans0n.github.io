Due to some health problems (I just recently underwent surgery) I’m stuck for 
**almost a month without being able to code**
, and even write this lines is an ordeal – I’m doing it using one hand only.

Thanks to all that I’m being able to detox of my last months non-stop coding antics, and improving my skills by reading technical stuff and new libraries.

**Hopefully when I’m back I’ll be better than before. Never stop learning and improving yourself.**
 Kaizen!
