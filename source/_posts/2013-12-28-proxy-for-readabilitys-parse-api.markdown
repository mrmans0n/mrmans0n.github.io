I created [this very little tiny project in Sinatra](https://github.com/mrmans0n/site-mobilizer) for being able to obscure the usage of the [Readability's Parser API](https://www.readability.com/developers/api/parser) token, as suggested in their documentation.

So, if you had any intention to use this, well... the little work you had to do is already taken care of.
