I know one must keep the cool in these situations but they make it hard. At least I know I must not answer, just ignoring them does the trick.

Ah, well, haven’t said it yet. I’m talking about the people who 
**punish your app**
 in the stores (App Store and Google Play mainly) just because the app doesn’t do this or that: they just downloaded your app by its name and didn’t read the 
**very first line of the description**
. 
“Oh, it’s crap, you can’t 
XXXX with this shit” it’s one of the most repeated statements, and of course it comes with the typical 
**one star**
 rating.

There are a lot of useful comments though, the ones suggesting new features you haven’t even thought of are a perfect example. They are encouraged. Though even if you add the feature requested, some people don’t bother to update their comments, and it also bugs me a little bit. At least in the App Store you can see at first glance the comments of the current version because the others are a little bit hidden.

Well, that’s about everything I wanted to rant about today.
