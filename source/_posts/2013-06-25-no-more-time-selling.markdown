I haven't wrote any page in the new site about selling hours (ie *accepting freelancing jobs*) because **I don't want to anymore**. I already have a full time job developing apps for clients and **I'm kind of fed up** with their whims and all the other oddities. 

So, as money is not an issue (and was the primary reason for accepting freelancing jobs), all that's left is the need for knowledge and **the thrill that only building things can give to you**. I'll continue with my side personal projects, improving them, developing new things... **shipping stuff**. 

For starters, a new big update for [BikeShare!](http://bikeshar.es) is coming soon. It might not be the most used app in the world, but I'm proud of it nevertheless. I will post about it when it's done, of course.
