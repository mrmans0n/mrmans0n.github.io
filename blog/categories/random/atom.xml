    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, I&rsquo;m kind of bored with the design stuff on my blog, so I just wanted to spice up things a little. Also, I&rsquo;ve wanted to try <em>Octopress</em> for a while&hellip; So what the heck, I wrote some export functions to my old blog, and programmed a little import script that converted all that info into Octopress compliant posts. So here it is.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll have to <em>find a new design</em> that makes me feel at home, and everything will be ready.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been reading some technical stuff lately. My latest prey has been
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>, by “Uncle Bob” Robert C. Martin.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/23/CleanCode.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It has been very revealing about a ton of stuff and made me think a lot about what I could improve, although I don’t 100% agree with everything Bob says. I’ve also applied some of the key points to the Android coding style I recently wrote for
<a href="http://www.mobivery.com">Mobivery</a>, in the naming conventions for example.</p>

<p>Well… It’s very recommended for everyone! I wish I read it in college.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Due to some health problems (I just recently underwent surgery) I’m stuck for
<strong>almost a month without being able to code</strong>
, and even write this lines is an ordeal – I’m doing it using one hand only.</p>

<p>Thanks to all that I’m being able to detox of my last months non-stop coding antics, and improving my skills by reading technical stuff and new libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Hopefully when I’m back I’ll be better than before. Never stop learning and improving yourself.</strong>
 Kaizen!</p>

    <id>http://mrmans0n.github.io/blog/2012/08/05/resistance-to-change</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The title of this post could be misleading. I’m not gonna talk about the
ever-existing resistance to change in requisites (even if you work in an agile environment).</p>

<p>What I wanted to talk about is
<strong>the resistance to change some of
us developers have regarding to technology</strong>
.</p>

<p>In our world we need to be constantly learning, even if our work doesn’t need us to, but the sad truth is
<strong>most of the people aren’t cut for this kind of thing</strong>
 and take the course of the minimum effort. It’s common to see engineers stuck in cobol, fortran and with absolutely no interest in learning challenging stuff for them. Even from a practical standpoint that sucks.</p>

<p>It is also common for us to whine
a lot when our favorite
IDE gets updated and improved, because we can’t find a shortcut or whatever, or when we want to change our
VCS. We shouldn’t because we would have two problems then: the whining and the original problem.</p>

<p>We have to keep learning, even if we’re not comfortable with it. If you want to be stuck, well, then maybe you should reconsider your career. No offense. Let’s get out of our comfort zone and improve ourselves!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know one must keep the cool in these situations but they make it hard. At least I know I must not answer, just ignoring them does the trick.</p>

<p>Ah, well, haven’t said it yet. I’m talking about the people who
<strong>punish your app</strong>
 in the stores (App Store and Google Play mainly) just because the app doesn’t do this or that: they just downloaded your app by its name and didn’t read the
<strong>very first line of the description</strong>
.
“Oh, it’s crap, you can’t
XXXX with this shit” it’s one of the most repeated statements, and of course it comes with the typical
<strong>one star</strong>
 rating.</p>

<p>There are a lot of useful comments though, the ones suggesting new features you haven’t even thought of are a perfect example. They are encouraged. Though even if you add the feature requested, some people don’t bother to update their comments, and it also bugs me a little bit. At least in the App Store you can see at first glance the comments of the current version because the others are a little bit hidden.</p>

<p>Well, that’s about everything I wanted to rant about today.</p>
