    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year has been good to me, in code and in personal life. Got to improve some personal projects, did some interesting things at work, and received pretty good news.</p>

<p>I finally got to give back, releasing some opensource projects like <a href="http://github.com/mrmans0n/localio">localio</a>, <a href="http://github.com/mrmans0n/clusterer">clusterer</a> or <a href="http://github.com/mobivery/smart-location-lib">smart-location-lib</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/2013-github.png" alt="GitHub contributions" /></p>

<p>I also had the most interesting vacation trip ever, got to think about what I want to do with my life and have a nice time.</p>

<p>On the dark side, I also experimented what we usually call <strong>burnout</strong> in summer. The solution was easy, as seen in the contribution &ldquo;punch card&rdquo;, I used my vacation time to do other stuff and finally got my shit together. And that&rsquo;s behind me now &ndash; now I&rsquo;m even on a coding streak!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to what 2014 has in store for me.</p>
