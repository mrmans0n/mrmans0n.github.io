    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working with the camera
<strong>is always a pain in the ass</strong>
. But at least in Android we have Intents. So, with little code we are able to get a working 300×300 thumbnail or even a picture with the best quality the device can offer. So I used it for a project few days ago because the project was in a hurry.</p>

<p>But things
<strong>got weird.</strong></p>

<p>The information stored in a Singleton was disappearing without a trace, and the information about sessions and current user of the app were nowhere to be found. Then a friend pointed me in the right direction, asking me to log something in the onCreate method of the current application just in case
<strong>the SO was killing the application</strong>
. And it was, indeed.</p>

<p>I had to perform some nasty tricks in the Singleton storing the session information, such as persisting some of the objects in SharedPreferences in Strings by converting them to
JSON, and the ones I couldn’t were implemented as Serializable objects and stored them in files in the application internal storage. It felt dirty and unnecessary, but had to be done. So if you can’t trust the system to persist your application memory data, I just don’t know what can you trust.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m kind of
<strong>fed up with Eclipse</strong>
. I acknowledge it’s a good
IDE, but too broad and too cluttered for me.</p>

<p>So after I returned to work after my forced leave, I finally got to put in practice one of my new year resolutions: switch to
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ
IDEA</a>. And when I finally got it to work with my maven setup it was all joy and happiness tears.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/22/darcula-minimized.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And also switched my Ruby / Rails
IDE to
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine 5</a>, though I haven’t bought it yet (still on trial though).</p>

<p>But AppCode still doesn’t do it for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Worst job offer ever.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/21/cto_intern.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A
CTO offer, with that many technologies required (they ask for high skill in them)… 40h per week (8 hours/day) with a contract of 4 months being an intern. Yes, a
CTO intern. And for 600€ ($775). Unbelievable. I don’t know if cry or kill myself.</p>

<p>The worst part of it… 16 applicants.</p>

<strong>Command Line Tools</strong>
 after every Xcode update.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/15/thumb_clt.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I mean, if I install it once, why shouldn’t it be installed automatically after each update? Is it really that difficult?</p>

<p>I remember with love and fluffy feelings how my life was before all this. The command line tools were always there, you never had to do anything special… Ah, better times.</p>

<p>This post was powered by an awful day frustration.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are some recruiters that doesn’t seem to understand the word NO. They come again and again trying to recruit me but it’s funny because they offer me half my salary and much worse work conditions for a boring and meaningless work.</p>

<p>They come from consultory firms.</p>
