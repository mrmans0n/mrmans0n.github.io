    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I always read the same and never-ending articles / posts / tweets about Android&rsquo;s fragmentation. The same <a href="http://opensignal.com/reports/fragmentation.php">boring infographics</a>, the same Google Play pie charts with Android version penetration, and always the same argument about how the developers are crazy about it, like if it&rsquo;s impossible to code because of that reason. But hey, <strong>I&rsquo;m a developer, and I couldn&rsquo;t care less</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say there isn&rsquo;t any fragmentation at all, it would be a huge lie. There is, of course. But through the years <strong>Android tools and framework have improved A LOT</strong>, and they embrace fragmentation. The compatibility libraries help with the interesting framework APIs. The XML resources help with layouts for different types of screens, making us to be able to code once and display the information in many different ways, or with   graphical resources, by using XML drawables.</p>

<p>It just takes a little more to get used to, coming from iOS programming for example, where everything is thought to be <em>pixel perfect</em> (though that&rsquo;s changing too, with the AutoLayout and the rumors about new types of screens in the next iPhone iterations, but still). You can&rsquo;t use hardcoded pixels to measure. You don&rsquo;t have a pretty IDE assuring that your layout is going to look perfect everywhere. You just have to take that to heart and build your interfaces avoiding things like textures and fixed sizes, in a truly responsive way.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little harder to do it when talking about SDK support, as we know iOS versions have a lot of traction very fast. But, in my case, as <a href="http://www.mobivery.com">Mobivery</a> has the policy of supporting the two latest major versions by default, I can&rsquo;t  code at work and use the latest APIs either. So it&rsquo;s pretty much the same for me, I have to wait to use NSAttributedString in a native way too. Oh, but wait, it happens the same as in Android: there is a TTTAtributedString which does pretty much the same. Just like ActionBarSherlock or NineOldAndroids or many others I use for Android development.</p>

<p>As a little exercise left to the reader, just try to develop any universal app in iOS and the same app in Android. You will see how the actual code is pretty much the same, with the same exceptions. And now <strong>try to do it with a pure HTML5 app, and then kill yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>Each platform has its perks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working with the camera
<strong>is always a pain in the ass</strong>
. But at least in Android we have Intents. So, with little code we are able to get a working 300×300 thumbnail or even a picture with the best quality the device can offer. So I used it for a project few days ago because the project was in a hurry.</p>

<p>But things
<strong>got weird.</strong></p>

<p>The information stored in a Singleton was disappearing without a trace, and the information about sessions and current user of the app were nowhere to be found. Then a friend pointed me in the right direction, asking me to log something in the onCreate method of the current application just in case
<strong>the SO was killing the application</strong>
. And it was, indeed.</p>

<p>I had to perform some nasty tricks in the Singleton storing the session information, such as persisting some of the objects in SharedPreferences in Strings by converting them to
JSON, and the ones I couldn’t were implemented as Serializable objects and stored them in files in the application internal storage. It felt dirty and unnecessary, but had to be done. So if you can’t trust the system to persist your application memory data, I just don’t know what can you trust.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m kind of
<strong>fed up with Eclipse</strong>
. I acknowledge it’s a good
IDE, but too broad and too cluttered for me.</p>

<p>So after I returned to work after my forced leave, I finally got to put in practice one of my new year resolutions: switch to
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ
IDEA</a>. And when I finally got it to work with my maven setup it was all joy and happiness tears.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/22/darcula-minimized.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And also switched my Ruby / Rails
IDE to
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine 5</a>, though I haven’t bought it yet (still on trial though).</p>

<p>But AppCode still doesn’t do it for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Worst job offer ever.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/21/cto_intern.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A
CTO offer, with that many technologies required (they ask for high skill in them)… 40h per week (8 hours/day) with a contract of 4 months being an intern. Yes, a
CTO intern. And for 600€ ($775). Unbelievable. I don’t know if cry or kill myself.</p>

<p>The worst part of it… 16 applicants.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m always forgetting to install Xcode’s
<strong>Command Line Tools</strong>
 after every Xcode update.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/15/thumb_clt.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I mean, if I install it once, why shouldn’t it be installed automatically after each update? Is it really that difficult?</p>

<p>I remember with love and fluffy feelings how my life was before all this. The command line tools were always there, you never had to do anything special… Ah, better times.</p>

<p>This post was powered by an awful day frustration.</p>
