    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hiya.</p>

<p>Like many of you I’ve just installed the brand new OS X version, Mountain Lion, but to my surprise it borked my
<a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> installation, and with it my
ImageMagick and even my
git.</p>

<p>After hours fighting I’ve found the solution to all my problems in a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/1860902">gist</a></p>

<p>Here it goes:</p>

<p>Also remember to run this for upgrading all your soft.</p>

<p>brew update
brew upgrade</p>

<p>Then I had problems installing
git, Homebrew didn’t let me.</p>

<p>~  brew update
/usr/local/.git: Permission denied</p>

<p>I’ve found the solution in this other
<a href="https://gist.github.com/768518">gist</a>. As it’s just code, only by executing curl to its raw file the problem was solved.</p>

<p>curl <a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/768518/c8ab96eab24829fa3bd8f8d4bba975f60c7d0079/fix_homebrew.rb">https://raw.github.com/gist/768518/c8ab96eab24829fa3bd8f8d4bba975f60c7d0079/fix_homebrew.rb</a> | ruby</p>

<p>Then I tried to run my rails server, but RMagick was throwing some errors. I took a deep look and noticed ImageMagick was broken as well. So, time to Homebrew again.</p>

<p>brew install imagemagick</p>

<p>Got some problems also with linking because I came from some already-installed-but-not-properly-for-Mountain-Lion setup. But linking all the problematic stuff with -f flag did the trick. For example:</p>

<p>brew link -f libtiff</p>

<p>Then insisting and insisting with its installation, everything was properly installed again. Phew.</p>

<p>Regards to all the authors of the gists I used. You guys are awesome.</p>
