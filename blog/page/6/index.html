	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I had a little problem today with one of my managed sites, one that was using
<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html">ActionMailer</a> for sending mails in a
Contact Us form using GMail’s
SMTP.</p>

<p>But reading server logs wasn’t very enlightening.</p>

<p>$ tail log/production.log
Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 533ms
Net::SMTPAuthenticationError (535-5.7.1 Please log in with your web browser and then try again. Learn more at
):
app/controllers/contact_controller.rb:11:in `create&#8217;</p>

<p>And that was all. That line of code was a simple…</p>

<p>NotificationsMailer.new_message(@message).deliver</p>

<p>…so I investigated a lot of workarounds, double-checked my configurations and everything seemed perfect.</p>

<p>But then it came to me. I logged to the account that was being used to send all the mails, and this was on the inbox.</p>

<blockquote><p>User,</p></blockquote>

<p>Someone recently tried to use an application to sign in to your Google Account, <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x6f;&#117;&#x72;&#46;&#x73;&#x65;&#110;&#100;&#x65;&#114;&#46;&#x65;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#46;">&#111;&#x75;&#114;&#46;&#115;&#101;&#x6e;&#x64;&#x65;&#114;&#x2e;&#101;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#64;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;&#46;</a> We prevented the sign-in attempt in case this was a hijacker trying to access your account.

<p>I investigated a bit and realized that my account wasn’t using 2-step verification.
<strong>So I configured the account with 2-step verification and created a specific password for my web app</strong>

		<p>I know one must keep the cool in these situations but they make it hard. At least I know I must not answer, just ignoring them does the trick.</p>

<p>Ah, well, haven’t said it yet. I’m talking about the people who
<strong>punish your app</strong>
 in the stores (App Store and Google Play mainly) just because the app doesn’t do this or that: they just downloaded your app by its name and didn’t read the
<strong>very first line of the description</strong>
.
“Oh, it’s crap, you can’t
XXXX with this shit” it’s one of the most repeated statements, and of course it comes with the typical
<strong>one star</strong>
 rating.</p>

<p>There are a lot of useful comments though, the ones suggesting new features you haven’t even thought of are a perfect example. They are encouraged. Though even if you add the feature requested, some people don’t bother to update their comments, and it also bugs me a little bit. At least in the App Store you can see at first glance the comments of the current version because the others are a little bit hidden.</p>

<p>Well, that’s about everything I wanted to rant about today.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hiya.</p>

<p>Like many of you I’ve just installed the brand new OS X version, Mountain Lion, but to my surprise it borked my
<a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> installation, and with it my
ImageMagick and even my
git.</p>

<p>After hours fighting I’ve found the solution to all my problems in a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/1860902">gist</a></p>

<p>Here it goes:</p>

<p>Also remember to run this for upgrading all your soft.</p>

<p>brew update
brew upgrade</p>

<p>Then I had problems installing
git, Homebrew didn’t let me.</p>

<p>~  brew update
/usr/local/.git: Permission denied</p>

<p>I’ve found the solution in this other
<a href="https://gist.github.com/768518">gist</a>. As it’s just code, only by executing curl to its raw file the problem was solved.</p>

<p>curl <a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/768518/c8ab96eab24829fa3bd8f8d4bba975f60c7d0079/fix_homebrew.rb">https://raw.github.com/gist/768518/c8ab96eab24829fa3bd8f8d4bba975f60c7d0079/fix_homebrew.rb</a> | ruby</p>

<p>Then I tried to run my rails server, but RMagick was throwing some errors. I took a deep look and noticed ImageMagick was broken as well. So, time to Homebrew again.</p>

<p>brew install imagemagick</p>

<p>Got some problems also with linking because I came from some already-installed-but-not-properly-for-Mountain-Lion setup. But linking all the problematic stuff with -f flag did the trick. For example:</p>

<p>brew link -f libtiff</p>

<p>Then insisting and insisting with its installation, everything was properly installed again. Phew.</p>

<p>Regards to all the authors of the gists I used. You guys are awesome.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I’ve been a little bit surprised lately watching the stats of my new app,
<a href="http://bikeshar.es">BikeShare!</a>, on Google Play Store.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s regarding the Android OS mainly used by its users.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/3/thumb_BikeShare-Stats.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can see that
<strong>4.0+ versions have much more adoption than 2.2/2.3.x</strong>
, just the opposite as the official stats say. Maybe it’s because the new Android adopters tend to download a lot of apps, and the
old-droiders are more content with the ones they already installed.</p>

<p>Or maybe, just maybe, it’s because the countries adopting it.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/4/thumb_BikeShare-Countries.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>(Spain, Canada, United States, Mexico, Ireland, Argentina, Norway, Australia)</p>

<p>Then we can compare it to the stats of other of my free apps,
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.audev.batteryinfowidget">Battery Info Widget</a>, much more widespread and in the Play Store for more than one year.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/5/thumb_BatteryInfo-Stats.png" alt="" /><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/8/thumb_BatteryInfo-Countries.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>(Japan, Spain, United States, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, United Kingdom, Germany, Peru)</p>

<p>Here the stats are much closer to the official android versions chart.</p>

<p>My thoughts are: should we focus on the people who won’t download apps, or to the new adopters / people with brand new phones?
IMHO the latter are much more interesting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I’ve been working in my free time lately coding a little app for
<strong>Android 2.2+</strong>
 in order to train myself in some disciplines I’ve never had the chance to use, and… just because. Its name is
<strong>BikeShare!</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/1/thumb_bikeshare_logo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can visit its web for more information:
<a href="http://bikeshar.es">bikeshar.es</a></p>

<p>For the lazy ones: it’s an app to use daily if you use public bikes in one of the 45 different supported cities. It allows you to favorite and see the details of all stations near you and helps you to find them if you don’t know the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I have a
very big roadmap for this one, with lots of things I’d like to do, but I’ll see how is it working first. Don’t want to repeat past mistakes, when I only published things to the public after lots and lots and lots of features were done. Now
<strong>I’ll start from a simple approach</strong>
 and I’ll see how it goes and what the users ask me to do.</p>

<p>Probably one thing I’ll do either way will be to
<strong>implement some widgets</strong>
 to the app.</p>

<p>Well, I hope you like it – and you find it useful :)</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>But let me rephrase that. There are
<strong>meetings</strong>
 and there are
meetings. And there is the chance there are shitloads of them and then you’re sad. Of course, daily meetings for status report are not up for discussion.</p>

<p>When you are preparing a big estimation for a project where lots of things must be discussed, you should take whatever the time you need. That’s a fact.</p>

<p>But too long meetings (without any kind of coffee time) or chained meetings is what drives us crazy. And specially when they are pointless. Yes, sure, we are psychotic and sociopaths who only like to code and not to socialize, whatever.</p>

<p>I had a fearsome boss that made me tremble only by saying “let’s meet”. You knew you wouldn’t be able to get in the zone again that day, and your productivity was going to be absolutely nil. The meetings would be eternal, getting longer and longer for the most absurd things. He hadn’t a technical profile, but still…</p>

<p>So, to conclude: Meetings,
<strong>yes</strong>
. Lots of them,
<strong>no</strong>
.</p>

		<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_TheAway/status/221114784672776193">A friend of mine tweeted yesterday</a> about a conversation he overheard when he was having a coffee at a bar.</p>

<p>They were talking about computer specialists in general, stating that none of us is good, and
outrageously they asked for a wage over 700€/month. Seriously, I still don’t know what angered me more: the disdain or the ridiculous wage.</p>

<p>We work in a field of expertise that always asks for more and we must be learning new things always or we are useless. There are few lines of work where this happens. We go to the university and we graduate knowing that in 5/10 years tops all we learnt technology-related is completely anachronic. Of course there are exceptions
IMHO.</p>

<p>But what the f*ck were they expecting offering less than 700€? Of course, if you hire someone offering less than what an intern is worth, you can never expect to have things done!</p>

<p>That conversation was wrong in so many ways I’d better stop thinking about it and enjoy my weekend. A weekend where, of course, I’ll be learning new things.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Two days ago
<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adt.html">ADT 20</a> was liberated, and I’ve been using it at work. So I thought I’d share my first impressions with you.</p>

<h3>What I love</h3>

<p>This one is easy. I love what you guys did with the layout editor. I hated down to the bone the fact I had to switch all the time between layout editor / outline / properties windows. They redesigned everything here, and now I find it a lot more usable.</p>

<p>The new logcat handling is pretty good, although I didn’t have any particular complaints about the old version.</p>

<p>One thing that made my day is the fact that you can press
<strong>cmd</strong>
 and hover over any resource, and you
finally have relevant options! Who wanted to see its definition in R.java? No- f*kin -one! You can see the string value or open the layout with the layout editor, for example. Awesome. At last.</p>

<p>Still hadn’t had the time to try the new performance viewer so I will refrain commenting about that one.</p>

<h3>What I hate</h3>

<p>Seriously, what were you thinking? At least, in the first version available (the one I’m using right now), I have to clean up my projects every time I change something at UI level. It’s annoying as hell.</p>

<p>Of course, I hate Eclipse, but that’s not new. Someday I’ll be able to code in something like Visual Studio or even better for all the platforms I really dig. In fact, that’s what really makes me want to code some Windows Phone stuff: its wonderful
IDE.</p>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>

<p>Well, first of all, the should fix the issues asap. I don’t like Eclipse a lot so it’s like adding fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>However, each version they are improving the experience a lot. I still miss some more refactoring options, of course, but they’re going in the right direction.</p>
