An error occured while installing libv8 (3.3.10.4), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that <code>gem install libv8 -v '3.3.10.4'</code> succeeds before bundling.</p>

<p>After some headbanging against the wall, I’ve found that
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8126465/bundle-install-update-libv8-therubyracer-installation-fails-with-native-ex/8127559#8127559">it’s a common error</a> and I tried to solve it with some of the solutions there, like uninstalling therubyracer and libv8 gems. Didn’t worked.</p>

<p>So I tried upgrading bundler.</p>

<p>$ sudo gem install bundler &mdash;pre
Successfully installed bundler-1.2.0.rc.2
1 gem installed
Installing ri documentation for bundler-1.2.0.rc.2&hellip;
Installing RDoc documentation for bundler-1.2.0.rc.2&hellip;</p>

<p>But didn’t do the trick. Then
<strong>I checked my ruby and rails versions</strong>
, and while rails was at its newest,
<strong>my ruby installation was the one provided by Apple</strong>
.</p>

<p>$ ruby -v
ruby 1.8.7 (2012-02-08 patchlevel 358) [universal-darwin12.0]</p>

<p>Then I realized I hadn’t installed rvm in my new installation of Mountain Lion, so
<a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install/">I did it as expected</a> : install it and use the newest ruby version.</p>

<p>Then with this one…</p>

<p>$ ruby -v
ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin12.0.0]</p>

<p>…I tried again to
<strong>bundle install</strong>
 and to my surprise, it was fixed. I lost precious work hours because of this, so I hope it helps you too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m always being told that
<strong>it’s too difficult and even impossible make good interfaces and beautiful apps in Android</strong>
. And I always say the same: given the time and the thought needed, it is more than possible.</p>

<p>Lately more and more
multi-platform apps are embracing
<strong>Holo</strong>
, and they are doing it right. For example, the last iteration of
<a href="https://foursquare.com">foursquare</a> it’s a good example of a famous app doing things better.</p>

<p>The most recent app, and the reason I’m writing this is
<strong>Pinterest</strong>
.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/11/thumb_pinterest.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>They released their iOS app long time ago and Android was left behind, but I think it was worth, because
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinterest">they just released their Android app</a> and it’s
gorgeous. Custom smooth animations, clever use of the Action Bar, slick design… It’s really a delight. It’s an example to follow, really, even with its rough edges (due to novelty).</p>

<p>Too bad I don’t care about the social network itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title of this post could be misleading. I’m not gonna talk about the
ever-existing resistance to change in requisites (even if you work in an agile environment).</p>

<p>What I wanted to talk about is
<strong>the resistance to change some of
us developers have regarding to technology</strong>
.</p>

<p>In our world we need to be constantly learning, even if our work doesn’t need us to, but the sad truth is
<strong>most of the people aren’t cut for this kind of thing</strong>
 and take the course of the minimum effort. It’s common to see engineers stuck in cobol, fortran and with absolutely no interest in learning challenging stuff for them. Even from a practical standpoint that sucks.</p>

<p>It is also common for us to whine
a lot when our favorite
IDE gets updated and improved, because we can’t find a shortcut or whatever, or when we want to change our
VCS. We shouldn’t because we would have two problems then: the whining and the original problem.</p>

<p>We have to keep learning, even if we’re not comfortable with it. If you want to be stuck, well, then maybe you should reconsider your career. No offense. Let’s get out of our comfort zone and improve ourselves!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m subscribed to some
<strong>premium services</strong>
, and there are two that are
literally essential to me as a developer. I’m talking about
<a href="http://www.spotify.con">Spotify</a> and
<a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been an
<strong>Spotify</strong>
 subscriber for more than two years. I always code with music, call it white noise, call it whatever you want, I just need something on the background to let me focus and reach
the zone.</p>

<p>My music varies, it depends on the day and my mood. For analysis and more-thinking-than-coding moments, I usually end up listening to some OSTs like Mass Effect (
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/3f4qclJfQLXc1xapUxUEJq">1</a>, 2 and
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/4AqNrJQ3uSoonTUgvBQHMX">3</a>), Gothic 3,
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/6cadOIa5DTh6a5mGo5r4bh">Trent Reznor + Atticus Ross</a> soundtracks (
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/0mAK8JyX2On5kLC3VMMgm7">TGWTDT</a> /
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1ijkFiMeHopKkHyvQCWxUa">The Social Network</a>),
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/0YC192cP3KPCRWx8zr8MfZ">Hans Zimmer OSTs</a> or some medleys like
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/6mpHl6so8tgC8TLGXb8e2O">Video Games Live</a> and
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/3bBCofH4VxHokZ6fRCgbGx">The Greatest Video Game Music</a>. For the moments of
really awesome and destroyer coding I prefer something a little bit electronic like
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/1GwxXgEc6oxCKQ5wykWXFs">Prodigy</a>,
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/7MqnCTCAX6SsIYYdJCQj9B">Pendulum</a> or even more dark stuff like
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/3V4IvzRQYP5mzuVtkcHgVa">KMFDM</a>,
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/2KaW48xlLnXC2v8tvyhWsa">Amaranthe</a> or
<a href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/0tQn2q1TIEenLgodtb8Nhx">Zeromancer</a>. But most of the time I listen to metal bands and even punk/punk rock, depends on the mood. Of course, I’m talking about coding hours. I also use it in my free time, ain’t it awesome?</p>

<p>Also, I’ve been a
<strong>GitHub</strong>
 subscriber for some months now. I needed some private repos and it gave me the push I needed to throw my money to the screen. I like the idea and philosophy a lot. It’s our very own (developer’s) social network, and for some time it’s been my second code-related site in number of visits. Of course, the first is
<a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>.</p>

<p>And
<a href="http://octodex.github.com/">Octocat</a> is fucking awesome.</p>

<p>I also use a lot
<strong>Evernote</strong>
, but still not at the level needed to pay for it. But give me time…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a little problem today with one of my managed sites, one that was using
<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html">ActionMailer</a> for sending mails in a
Contact Us form using GMail’s
SMTP.</p>

<p>But reading server logs wasn’t very enlightening.</p>

<p>$ tail log/production.log
Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 533ms
Net::SMTPAuthenticationError (535-5.7.1 Please log in with your web browser and then try again. Learn more at
):
app/controllers/contact_controller.rb:11:in `create&#8217;</p>

<p>And that was all. That line of code was a simple…</p>

<p>NotificationsMailer.new_message(@message).deliver</p>

<p>…so I investigated a lot of workarounds, double-checked my configurations and everything seemed perfect.</p>

<p>But then it came to me. I logged to the account that was being used to send all the mails, and this was on the inbox.</p>

<blockquote><p>User,</p></blockquote>

<p>Someone recently tried to use an application to sign in to your Google Account, <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6f;&#117;&#x72;&#x2e;&#x73;&#101;&#x6e;&#100;&#101;&#x72;&#46;&#101;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;&#46;">&#111;&#x75;&#x72;&#x2e;&#115;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x64;&#101;&#x72;&#x2e;&#x65;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#64;&#103;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;&#46;</a> We prevented the sign-in attempt in case this was a hijacker trying to access your account. Please review the details of the sign-in attempt:</p>

<p>Sunday, July 29, 2012 6:55:17 PM
GMT</p>

<p>IP Address: 123.456.789.101</p>

<p>Location: Paris, France</p>

<p>If you do not recognize this sign-in attempt, someone else might be trying to access your account. You should sign in to your account and reset your password immediately. Find out how at <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts?p=reset_pw">http://support.google.com/accounts?p=reset_pw</a></p>

<p>If this was you, and you want to give this application access to your account, complete the troubleshooting steps listed at <a href="http://support.google.com/mail?p=client_login">http://support.google.com/mail?p=client_login</a></p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>The Google Accounts Team</p>

<p>I investigated a bit and realized that my account wasn’t using 2-step verification.
<strong>So I configured the account with 2-step verification and created a specific password for my web app</strong>
, changed it in my configuration and everything worked again flawlessly.</p>

<p>PD: If you are wondering what’s my configuration in config/application.rb, here it goes, in case it helps you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know one must keep the cool in these situations but they make it hard. At least I know I must not answer, just ignoring them does the trick.</p>

<p>Ah, well, haven’t said it yet. I’m talking about the people who
<strong>punish your app</strong>
 in the stores (App Store and Google Play mainly) just because the app doesn’t do this or that: they just downloaded your app by its name and didn’t read the
<strong>very first line of the description</strong>
.
“Oh, it’s crap, you can’t
XXXX with this shit” it’s one of the most repeated statements, and of course it comes with the typical
<strong>one star</strong>
 rating.</p>

<p>There are a lot of useful comments though, the ones suggesting new features you haven’t even thought of are a perfect example. They are encouraged. Though even if you add the feature requested, some people don’t bother to update their comments, and it also bugs me a little bit. At least in the App Store you can see at first glance the comments of the current version because the others are a little bit hidden.</p>

<p>Well, that’s about everything I wanted to rant about today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hiya.</p>

<p>Like many of you I’ve just installed the brand new OS X version, Mountain Lion, but to my surprise it borked my
<a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> installation, and with it my
ImageMagick and even my
git.</p>

<p>After hours fighting I’ve found the solution to all my problems in a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/1860902">gist</a></p>

<p>Here it goes:</p>

<p>Also remember to run this for upgrading all your soft.</p>

<p>brew update
brew upgrade</p>

<p>Then I had problems installing
git, Homebrew didn’t let me.</p>

<p>~  brew update
/usr/local/.git: Permission denied</p>

<p>I’ve found the solution in this other
<a href="https://gist.github.com/768518">gist</a>. As it’s just code, only by executing curl to its raw file the problem was solved.</p>

<p>curl <a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/768518/c8ab96eab24829fa3bd8f8d4bba975f60c7d0079/fix_homebrew.rb">https://raw.github.com/gist/768518/c8ab96eab24829fa3bd8f8d4bba975f60c7d0079/fix_homebrew.rb</a> | ruby</p>

<p>Then I tried to run my rails server, but RMagick was throwing some errors. I took a deep look and noticed ImageMagick was broken as well. So, time to Homebrew again.</p>

<p>brew install imagemagick</p>

<p>Got some problems also with linking because I came from some already-installed-but-not-properly-for-Mountain-Lion setup. But linking all the problematic stuff with -f flag did the trick. For example:</p>

<p>brew link -f libtiff</p>

<p>Then insisting and insisting with its installation, everything was properly installed again. Phew.</p>

<p>Regards to all the authors of the gists I used. You guys are awesome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been a little bit surprised lately watching the stats of my new app,
<a href="http://bikeshar.es">BikeShare!</a>, on Google Play Store.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s regarding the Android OS mainly used by its users.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/3/thumb_BikeShare-Stats.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can see that
<strong>4.0+ versions have much more adoption than 2.2/2.3.x</strong>
, just the opposite as the official stats say. Maybe it’s because the new Android adopters tend to download a lot of apps, and the
old-droiders are more content with the ones they already installed.</p>

<p>Or maybe, just maybe, it’s because the countries adopting it.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/4/thumb_BikeShare-Countries.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>(Spain, Canada, United States, Mexico, Ireland, Argentina, Norway, Australia)</p>

<p>Then we can compare it to the stats of other of my free apps,
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.audev.batteryinfowidget">Battery Info Widget</a>, much more widespread and in the Play Store for more than one year.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/5/thumb_BatteryInfo-Stats.png" alt="" /><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/8/thumb_BatteryInfo-Countries.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>(Japan, Spain, United States, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, United Kingdom, Germany, Peru)</p>

<p>Here the stats are much closer to the official android versions chart.</p>

<p>My thoughts are: should we focus on the people who won’t download apps, or to the new adopters / people with brand new phones?
IMHO the latter are much more interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been working in my free time lately coding a little app for
<strong>Android 2.2+</strong>
 in order to train myself in some disciplines I’ve never had the chance to use, and… just because. Its name is
<strong>BikeShare!</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/1/thumb_bikeshare_logo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can visit its web for more information:
<a href="http://bikeshar.es">bikeshar.es</a></p>

<p>For the lazy ones: it’s an app to use daily if you use public bikes in one of the 45 different supported cities. It allows you to favorite and see the details of all stations near you and helps you to find them if you don’t know the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I have a
very big roadmap for this one, with lots of things I’d like to do, but I’ll see how is it working first. Don’t want to repeat past mistakes, when I only published things to the public after lots and lots and lots of features were done. Now
<strong>I’ll start from a simple approach</strong>
 and I’ll see how it goes and what the users ask me to do.</p>

<p>Probably one thing I’ll do either way will be to
<strong>implement some widgets</strong>
 to the app.</p>

<p>Well, I hope you like it – and you find it useful :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>But let me rephrase that. There are
<strong>meetings</strong>
 and there are
meetings. And there is the chance there are shitloads of them and then you’re sad. Of course, daily meetings for status report are not up for discussion.</p>

<p>When you are preparing a big estimation for a project where lots of things must be discussed, you should take whatever the time you need. That’s a fact.</p>

<p>But too long meetings (without any kind of coffee time) or chained meetings is what drives us crazy. And specially when they are pointless. Yes, sure, we are psychotic and sociopaths who only like to code and not to socialize, whatever.</p>

<p>I had a fearsome boss that made me tremble only by saying “let’s meet”. You knew you wouldn’t be able to get in the zone again that day, and your productivity was going to be absolutely nil. The meetings would be eternal, getting longer and longer for the most absurd things. He hadn’t a technical profile, but still…</p>

<p>So, to conclude: Meetings,
<strong>yes</strong>
. Lots of them,
<strong>no</strong>
.</p>
