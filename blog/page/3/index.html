		<p>I’ve come across many people who were always saying they were learning something but never accomplished anything. Always printing new tutorials, stashing them layer after layer in their tables, but never seemed to really get past transcribing a hello world in a new language. And a lot of trees were cut because of them and their paper heaps.</p>

<p><strong>That “learning” method is wrong</strong>
.</p>

<p>You can’t learn by simply reading in our developer world. If you are learning a new design pattern, you have to implement in a real scenario. If you are learning a new language, you have to have an accomplishable goal neither easy or hard, just something in between. If you are learning a new technology, you have to put it into practice and experiment with it.</p>

<p>Theory doesn’t work for most people, your coding brain isn’t made for that. You have to learn by being proactive, by
<strong>doing things</strong>
. Copying an example doesn’t work. You can use them as a base, sure, but you can’t just copy it. You have to play with it, experiment, change, try, fail, try again, fail again, and finally get what you want working.</p>

<p>It was always this way with me: hitting a wall multiple times and then overcoming the obstacles. I can’t conceive any other way. And with all I’ve seen with the
printing tutorials a gogo guys, experience agrees with me.</p>

<p>I’ve been witness to some technical Android UI performance discussion between
<a href="http://twitter.com/joenrv">Joaquim Vergès</a> (developer of the recently released and awesome Falcon Pro twitter client) and
<a href="http://twitter.com/romainguy">Romain Guy</a> (Google Android engineer), and by reading them I realized
<strong>how often we ignore some very clear guidelines that even lint tells us</strong>
 (such as overdrawing issues), that impact in the framerate of our scrolling in Android apps.</p>

<p>After all the discussion, Romain Guy synthesized his analysis
<a href="http://www.curious-creature.org/docs/android-performance-case-study-1.html">in a post in his web</a>.
<strong>Very recommended reading</strong>
 for a Sunday morning
IMHO.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>If you have this problem, like I had few moments ago deploying this web last version, the solution is simple.</p>

<p>rake aborted!
You have already activated rake 10.0.2, but your Gemfile requires rake 0.9.2.2. Using bundle exec may solve this.
/home/domain/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/bundler-1.2.3/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:31:in <code>block in setup'
/home/domain/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/bundler-1.2.3/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:17:in</code>setup&#8217;
/home/domain/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/bundler-1.2.3/lib/bundler.rb:116:in <code>setup'

/home/domain/rails_deploys/nlopez.in/Rakefile:5:in `<top (required)>&lsquo;
(See full trace by running task with &mdash;trace)</p>

<p>The solution is pretty simple:</p>

<p>$ gem uninstall rake</p>

<p>And deploy again. Works like a charm. Don’t worry,
<strong>your rake won’t go anywhere</strong>
. The thing is, you had installed it
<strong>twice</strong>

		<p><em>Link</em>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bikeshare">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bikeshare</a></p>

<p>Been working hard last week in my spare time, as
<strong>I haven’t been able of disconnecting my brain after a month and a half non-stop working</strong>
, in my beloved BikeShare! app.</p>

<p>And I’ve accomplished a lot, in my kaizen and never-stop-learning style. I wanted to check out
<strong>Heroku</strong>
 for a rails app, and I wanted to use
<strong>rails-api gem</strong>
 for building some functionality without the web overhead in Rails, so I thought of building some services on top of BikeShare! such as
<strong>comments for stations</strong>
,
<strong>problem reporting</strong>
 and
<strong>suggestions</strong>
.</p>

<p>Turns out I liked the experience very much so I’m already thinking of more
magic I can do with it.</p>

<p>That’s for server side. Client side I wanted to try
<a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-android">Spring for Android</a> for consuming my brand new
REST service. So after some headaches with the
<a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/">Jackson</a> configuration needed for my DTOs I got it working. And it was awesome. With very little code I was able to consume all the
REST methods I wanted in about 10 minutes of code.</p>

<p><a href="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/19/2012-11-18_17.38.28.png"><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/19/thumb_2012-11-18_17.38.28.png" alt="" /></a>
<a href="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/20/2012-11-18_17.36.22.png"><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/20/thumb_2012-11-18_17.36.22.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The UI for comments is pretty simple, though I will be adding more sugar to it if it turns out to be used by people.</p>

<p>I was gonna stop there for this major but I got rid of my lazyness and wanted to experiment a little more, now more UI based stuff. I’ve been wanting to use Android 3.0+ animations for quite a long time, and had starred
<a href="http://nineoldandroids.com/">NineOldAndroids</a> in my GitHub for some time too, so it was time to try it for good.</p>

<p>And what a pleasant surprise it was. I’ve been always whining about the animations in Android and how ugly the code for them had to be. But now that’s over. I’ve only used a few animation tricks in the app but it was a delight: simple and clean code, and pretty good performance too. But hey, let them come naturally.</p>

<p>Then I realized
<strong>I’ve come to despise the simple look of the lists of the app</strong>
. First I tried to make a cooler favorites section. I like the Foursquare for Android look since the last major UI overhaul, so I tried to make something that resembled the “explore” tab from that app but with the look and feel of the app.</p>

<p>But it’d be weird if only the favorite section had this style. What about the station list? It’s the most used part of the app, and it needed some love too.</p>

<p>For starters, it was shameful it didn’t have any search capabilities. I always ended giving up when trying to add new stations to favorites, because I wasn’t able to find the stations far from home (or the current location whatsoever). That’s the first thing I did. Taking advantage of the recent support in
<a href="http://actionbarsherlock.com/">ActionBarSherlock</a> of the SearchView it was pretty straightforward to implement.</p>

<p>Then some new design was needed. So what about some “lite” version of the one already in favorites? Said and done.</p>

<p>It’s as fast as before, and has some more relevant information added to it, such as the map background and the real name of the station (comes with the web service). In fact the searching is performed in both the name and the address of the station, so it’s easier to get the one you are looking for.</p>

<p><a href="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/17/2012-11-18_17.46.49.png"><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/17/thumb_2012-11-18_17.46.49.png" alt="" /></a>
<a href="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/18/2012-11-18_17.47.09.png"><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/18/thumb_2012-11-18_17.47.09.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I really hope the users will like it, as I’m really proud of the result. Of course, in a week or so I’ll be pissed with a feature and I’ll want to change it. But hey, I also want the users to send suggestions and report problems with the respective new sections. That’s their raison d’être after all.</p>

		<p>Last month and a half we’ve been working on an “after-work” app for an internal contest in
<a href="http://www.mobivery.com">Mobivery</a> just to see if we could make it.</p>

<p><strong>We’ve worked our asses off</strong>
, our weekends were excuses to work even more, but
<strong>the result is awesome</strong>
. We’ve done a multiplatform app with server side, all from scratch, and
<strong>works</strong>
. It’s even useful!</p>

<p>I’ve personally been working in the Android app, and I’m pretty satisfied with the result. After all the usual annoyances of working for clients when it comes to a multiplatform native apps, when always the client wants to force you to do things in Android with an iOS style, it was a delight doing a truly Android-style app without random bitching.</p>

<p>The contest is over now. I hope we’ll win but doesn’t really matter: it was fun and rewarding by itself.</p>

<p>At the moment we can’t disclose what’s it about but I’ll comment something when it’s out.</p>

		<p>Lately I’ve been working in a multiplatform app using HTML5, me being a native enthusiast.</p>

<p>And yes, it’s
<strong>cheaper and faster</strong>
, and whatever you want… but
<strong>I still don’t quite like it for “serious” apps</strong>
. With serious I mean well crafted and smooth apps. I found discouraging the
<strong>lack of control</strong>
 you have, and everything you want to do right must use a bridge of communication with its native counterpart.</p>

<p>I’m always being told that Titanium is cool, that PhoneGap is useful… I doubt it but I haven’t experienced it yet, because the app I’m working on will not use any kind of framework (besides jQuery).</p>

<p>But hey, who am I to discuss this. Facebook is running away from it too! They should know what they are doing, right?</p>

<p>At least I can state my opinion quite clearly: I prefer native all the way. Maybe it’s just me.</p>
