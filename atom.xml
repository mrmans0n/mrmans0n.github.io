    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven&rsquo;t wrote any page in the new site about selling hours (ie <em>accepting freelancing jobs</em>) because <strong>I don&rsquo;t want to anymore</strong>. I already have a full time job developing apps for clients and <strong>I&rsquo;m kind of fed up</strong> with their whims and all the other oddities.</p>

<p>So, as money is not an issue (and was the primary reason for accepting freelancing jobs), all that&rsquo;s left is the need for knowledge and <strong>the thrill that only building things can give to you</strong>. I&rsquo;ll continue with my side personal projects, improving them, developing new things&hellip; <strong>shipping stuff</strong>.</p>

<p>For starters, a new big update for <a href="http://bikeshar.es">BikeShare!</a> is coming soon. It might not be the most used app in the world, but I&rsquo;m proud of it nevertheless. I will post about it when it&rsquo;s done, of course.</p>

<p>And, for the first time ever, Sense is not a bother. It’s just beautiful.</p>

<p>But nevertheless I’m excited about the Google Edition when it comes at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Also I’ve stumbled upon a brand new

, courtesy of
<a href="http://www.mobivery.com">Mobivery</a>, for testing purposes.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/30/iphone-4s.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The dual core in iOS is a must since iOS 6, my old iPhone 4 couldn’t keep up at all (and when I tried iOS 7 beta 1 there, I swear I saw the iPhone phisically sweat). So pretty excited to try my stuff in there too, and see it runs smoothly.</p>

<p>Instrumentation tests, there I go!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There were some major changes to Android
SDK layout, mainly moving all the build tools to another directory, with the pretty self-explanatory name “build-tools”.</p>

<p>But since the version of
<strong>maven-android-plugin</strong>
 almost everybody uses at the moment (3.5.0) can’t handle this, we have to fix it – and be able to
<strong>WORK</strong>
 and stuff.</p>

<p>Pretty simple, just get the new stable version (at this moment is 3.6.0).</p>

<p>And that should do the trick.</p>

<p>You should change your pom to reflect it, of course. For example:</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<pre><code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;android-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;3.6.0&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;sdk&gt;
                    &lt;platform&gt;17&lt;/platform&gt;
                &lt;/sdk&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.5&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;source&gt;1.6&lt;/source&gt;
                &lt;target&gt;1.6&lt;/target&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>This article was fixed when 3.6.0 came up, as it explained before how to get 3.5.4-
SNAPSHOT working on your local machine.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working with the camera
<strong>is always a pain in the ass</strong>
. But at least in Android we have Intents. So, with little code we are able to get a working 300×300 thumbnail or even a picture with the best quality the device can offer. So I used it for a project few days ago because the project was in a hurry.</p>

<p>But things
<strong>got weird.</strong></p>

<p>The information stored in a Singleton was disappearing without a trace, and the information about sessions and current user of the app were nowhere to be found. Then a friend pointed me in the right direction, asking me to log something in the onCreate method of the current application just in case
<strong>the SO was killing the application</strong>
. And it was, indeed.</p>

<p>I had to perform some nasty tricks in the Singleton storing the session information, such as persisting some of the objects in SharedPreferences in Strings by converting them to
JSON, and the ones I couldn’t were implemented as Serializable objects and stored them in files in the application internal storage. It felt dirty and unnecessary, but had to be done. So if you can’t trust the system to persist your application memory data, I just don’t know what can you trust.</p>

<p>The wait seemed so long… 6 and a half days later,
<strong>BikeShare! is on the App Store</strong>
. As
<a href="http://mrmans0n.github.io/shipping-as-fast-as-possible">I said it would</a> before.</p>

<p><a href="http://bikeshar.es"><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/28/promo_bikeshare_ios.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In fact, the wait time made me improve a lot the app I sent, so once it was released I uploaded a new version and started the cycle again… and “Waiting for Review”.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you like riding a bike and your city has a public bike services, and you happen to have an iPhone, maybe this app will help you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m taking
<strong>a different approach</strong>
 with my newest app,
<strong>BikeShare! for iOS</strong>
.</p>

<p>I always wanted to have a lot of functionality done before I could even think about shipping, but it seems a really bad idea now. Sure, the app would be awesome when done… but
<strong>when would that be</strong>
? I have very little free time and a lot of projects going on, shifting my focus from time to time due priority changes or even boredom whims, so it’s hard to know about times.</p>

<p>So I changed my mind. I decided on a basic core functionality and went with it. The 1.0 version will have that and nothing more.</p>

<p>Then I will have some valuable info I might need to know before adding more functionality. With the core done and some stats mining frameworks set up, like
<a href="http://www.mymalcom.com"><strong>Malcom</strong></a>, I can know for sure what my users might want to have in the next iterations.</p>

<p>All the extra functionality, even the stuff to make the app different from others,
<strong>will have to wait</strong>
. And hopefully I’ll get some feedback from the users.</p>

<p>And now, a teaser for you all.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/27/bikeshare-ios-sneak-peek.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The app is In Review, hopefully in one week or two will be rockin’ on the App Store.</p>

<p>It has been very revealing about a ton of stuff and made me think a lot about what I could improve, although I don’t 100% agree with everything Bob says. I’ve also applied some of the key points to the Android coding style I recently wrote for

<p>Some time ago this article spread like wildfire, stating the scientific facts we all coders know but are too lazy to look for.</p>

<p>What was my resolution then?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-439-Auriculares-abiertos/dp/B005N8W1TM"><img src="http://mrm.perry.es/uploads/admin/image/image/24/thumb_sennheiser-439.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I bought them.</p>

<p>I always try to get into the zone with good headphones and music (ahem, Spotify premium). That, and a little
respect of the people around me do the magic. Also, closing Mail and Messages help a little. And caffeine. Aren’t we coders picky?</p>

<p>An interrupted programmer is a buggy and angry one, and very prone to produce horrendous
code smells our future selves would be suicidal with.
<strong>Let us work, dammit!</strong></p>

<p>If we read it carefully, it seems that it cannot find wrap_parameters method, so we have to make some changes in the file /config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb, in the first block of code.</p>

<p><strong>We must replace the /config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb file with this one:</strong></p>

<p>I’ve also posted this workaround in

<strong>almost a month without being able to code</strong>

<p>Thanks to all that I’m being able to detox of my last months non-stop coding antics, and improving my skills by reading technical stuff and new libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Hopefully when I’m back I’ll be better than before. Never stop learning and improving yourself.</strong>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just found and posted in GitHub a pair of
<strong>old and forgotten projects</strong>
 I had around my HD:
<a href="https://github.com/mrmans0n/ThumbCreator">ThumbCreator</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mrmans0n/Patchwerk">Patchwerk</a>.</p>

<p>Both were developed with Visual Studio (C#). You wouldn’t believe how much I miss that
IDE now that I’m stuck with Eclipse and Xcode.</p>

<p><strong>They never were Opensource to begin with</strong>
, but what the heck, they are simple and maybe someone will send some pull requests with improvements or fixes – In fact, you are encouraged to do so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve come across many people who were always saying they were learning something but never accomplished anything. Always printing new tutorials, stashing them layer after layer in their tables, but never seemed to really get past transcribing a hello world in a new language. And a lot of trees were cut because of them and their paper heaps.</p>

<p><strong>That “learning” method is wrong</strong>
.</p>

<p>You can’t learn by simply reading in our developer world. If you are learning a new design pattern, you have to implement in a real scenario. If you are learning a new language, you have to have an accomplishable goal neither easy or hard, just something in between. If you are learning a new technology, you have to put it into practice and experiment with it.</p>

<p>Theory doesn’t work for most people, your coding brain isn’t made for that. You have to learn by being proactive, by
<strong>doing things</strong>
. Copying an example doesn’t work. You can use them as a base, sure, but you can’t just copy it. You have to play with it, experiment, change, try, fail, try again, fail again, and finally get what you want working.</p>

<p>It was always this way with me: hitting a wall multiple times and then overcoming the obstacles. I can’t conceive any other way. And with all I’ve seen with the
printing tutorials a gogo guys, experience agrees with me.</p>

<p>We suffered in silence for lots of time, but Google at last heard our cries.
<strong>MapFragment</strong>
 is here to stay!</p>

<p>The new upgrade to the api features also
<strong>PhotoSphere integration</strong>
. but hey, that’s like the cherry on top of the cherry of a sundae.</p>

<p>Ah, man, I feel relieved now. I’ve got something to do to BikeShare! in the following days… remove the hacky part and
do it right. At last.</p>
